      "<p>Wanderful is a web app to connect users with fun, randomized destinations and things to do when they get there. Upon visiting the site, users are able to click on a button and be directed to a destination details page for a randomly generated location from the database. Here users can view a brief description of the location and details such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment available at the location. Additionally, users can get flight information to the destination's nearest airport. Users are also able to create an account which allows them to save their favorite destinations and points of interest for later retrieval on the user's dashboard.</p>"
