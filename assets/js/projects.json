A random number generator dynamically updates the maximum value to the number of quotes in the object. The number generated fetches the data for the new quote.</p><p>Users can generate a new random quote with a button and can also tweet out the quote by clicking on the Tweet button. Upon clicking the tweet button, scripting first verifies that the quote and attribution are less than 140 characters combined, truncating the quote if necessary, and opens up a window with the tweet pre-filled.</p>",
