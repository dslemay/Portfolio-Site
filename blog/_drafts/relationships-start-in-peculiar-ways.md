![Celebrating our fake engagement 11 years later]({{ site.url }}/blog/assets/img/dist/2017/2017-09-fake-engagement.jpg)

11 years ago today I went to the mall with two friends in search of a store capable of a special engraving in a ring I was hoping to commission. One of the individuals joining me was a fairly new friend, while the other person was one of her friends that I hardly knew. We grabbed some Jamba Juice and wandered around the mall, including my ring shopping. Being 19 years old at the time, my ineptitude for asking informed questions of ring purveyors shined through. Donna, the person I hardly knew, stepped in and began asking the salespeople the questions that escaped me. Of course, there isn't much selection for plain band rings in a jewelry store except in the wedding ring section. Understandably, some of the salespeople began making some entertaining assumptions.

At one of the stores, while I was off in my thoughts, one of the staff went up to Donna to discuss said assumptions. The conversation entailed how the store staff see many couples come in and out of the stores searching for engagement rings, and occasionally they make bets on which couples will last and which ones will be coming back in a few months to return the rings. She told Donna that no one was making bets that we would come back, because they could tell we were going to make it. Mind you, Donna and I have known each other for a couple days at this time and had spent an insignificant time together. She just rolled with it, pulled our other friend to the side, and started laughing about the interaction. As I exited the store, I pressed on what was so entertaining until they finally divulged the story.

### The Fake Engagement

We continued on our way throughout the mall and kept on coming back to the earlier entertainment. At the time we were all attending a college which had been known for spontaneous relationships, including some which progressed at rapid pace. Around the same time we both came up with the idea to poke fun at this schema by getting "engaged." We hatched a plan on how to present the details of our new relationship and engagement with our college peers at dinner that evening. We delved into details such as how I proposed, why there was no ring, and began getting accustomed to using mushy relational language at each other without smirking or rolling on the floor in laughter. I can only imagine what people around us thought of the sight as we continued to develop our plan throughout the mall. It was hysterical.

We finally arrived back at campus and went to the cafeteria. We wasted no time to share the story of our sudden love and engagement to groups of friends in line and around the table. Slowly the crowd around our table grew as our naive peers soaked in our story. Some close friends immediately knew that it was all a rouse, but were good sports and went along with it. After dinner we went to a commons area to bake a celebratory cake. As the evening drew to a close we called off the engagement to avoid the vicious rumor mill, but had developed a strange and uncanny friendship in the process.

### What Happened Next

For the next several months our friendship grew as we both battled some difficult and tough situations in our respective lives. We went through some serious and life-altering times together, where our friendship helped us to make it through the shit life had thrown at us. Eventually we made it through everything, and after some more incredibly obtuse moments on my part, started dating. 2.5 years after our initial fake engagement that started our friendship, we got married.

Today, Donna surprised me after a meeting with a print of our fake engagement picture, and we proceeded to go back to the same mall, grabbed some Jamba Juice, and relived many memories. We even browsed through the same jewelry store. It's kind of funny looking back on everything and how it all began, especially since we didn't even know each other at the start of everything. Here we are, 11 years after the prescient words of a random jewelry sales staff.
